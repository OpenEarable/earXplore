## About the Project

This Web Project was build as an additional to support the exploration of research on interaction with earables (as defined in the respective paper [EarXplore: An Open Earable Research Database on Interaction](https://github.com/OpenEarable/earXplore "Link to the Study which introduces this Repository")<!-- Add the right link -->. For the motivation and methodology of the review we therefore encourage anyone interested to read the paper themselves. The Web Project visualizes the EarXplore Database in four distinct views:

- Tabular View
- Graphical View
- Similarity View
- Timeline View

Please refer to the [Usage Section](#usage) or [Forking Section](#forking) for more information.
